# Make a game

## Description
Welcome to the world of Object Oriented Javascript!  We will be utilizing constructors to make a turn based game that will live in the browser.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand Object Oriented principles as they apply to javascript
* Understand Constructors, how to use them and create instances.
* Understand the fundamentals of prototypical inheritance

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Use constructors to create instances of characters and game elements for play
* Use instances of a Constructor/Class in the DOM
* Use of prototyped methods that mutate the state of different instances.


## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `bower.json`
  * `main.js`
  * `index.html`

### Requirements

* Turn based game must at least have 3 Constructors
* Instances of each Constructor/Class must interact somehow to either mutate the original state of an instance or change values associated with instance.
* Some ideal game examples include: Mario Kart Clone, Blackjack, Space Fight, etc., but the core requirement is this game, consisting of constructors, is represented in the DOM as characters or other game elements.

## Normal Mode

Using your newfound knowledge of Constructors, you will create a game that has characters or players that interact somehow.

## Hard Mode

In addition to creating a game, allow for cheat codes and a score that will update when one player/character wins.
